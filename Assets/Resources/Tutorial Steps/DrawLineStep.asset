      Reconstruction!!

  - text: In this game, you play as an astronomer, studying stars and constellations,
      and your job is to figure out what the entire constellations look like, based
      on pictures of it

  - text: While this may seem daunting, it's actually rather simple.

  - text: Constellations are just groups of stars, connected in specific ways through
      star lines!

  - text: 'For you earthlings, remember that in space, there is no one right way
      to look at the constellation... Constellations that look completely different
      could end up having the same structure! We call these isomorphisms. '
    image: {fileID: 21300000, guid: f38deb8be4416403f8fec9e309b74a0e, type: 3}
  - text: For example, if you start from this constellation...

    image: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 882e59c35a3d949ac889ab9ee78da45a, type: 3}
  - text: You get an isomorphism!!

  - text: In fact, every one of these is an isomorphism of the original constellation
      too!! That means, all these constellations would be treated as identical.

      He travelled to every star in the constellation, and took a picture from that
      star towards the rest of the constellation\u2026 notice the problem??"

      a clown. Let's look at an example:"

  - text: Here is the full constellation, and the photos my assistant has took when
      he was on each star. Notice how every photo is identical (isomorphic) to the
      complete constellation, excluding the star that my assistant was standing on
      (and its lines)?

      constellation pattern in each picture, help me redraw the original constellation! '
